# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Metrics
Over the last few years, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has risen in popularity alongside the Generative AI revolution. RAG provides AI application builders a means to be able to leverage their own proprietary information to produce more informed results from a large language model (LLM). To help validate that an AI application builder can create an optimized RAG system, this page will cover a variety of novel RAG metrics.

!!! note
    Whetstone ML seeks to provide novel metrics not currently provided by other frameworks. We recommend other frameworks like [Ragas](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/) for a strong complementary set of RAG metrics not offered by Whetstone ML.
