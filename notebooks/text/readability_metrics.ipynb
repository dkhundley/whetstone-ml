    "Readability metrics are quantitative measures that are used to assess the readability of a text. They are used to evaluate how easy or difficult it is to read and understand a text. Readability metrics are based on various linguistic and cognitive factors, such as sentence length, word length, and vocabulary complexity.\n",

    "There are many different readability metrics, each with its own formula and interpretation. Some of the most commonly used readability metrics include:\n",

    "high_quality_text = \"\"\"Creating a strong password is your first line of defense in the digital age, where cyber threats constantly evolve. Hackers are increasingly adept at exploiting vulnerabilities, making it crucial to understand the importance of robust security measures. While it may be convenient to use simple and memorable combinations like birthdays or pet names, such choices are perilously insecure. They leave your personal and financial information exposed to malicious attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a password as a digital fortress. To build this fortress, security experts recommend a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The complexity of such a password makes it significantly more difficult for hackers to crack using brute-force methods. Additionally, the length of your password plays a pivotal role; each extra character exponentially increases the time required to breach it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not just about creating a single strong password, though. Using unique passwords for each of your accounts is essential. A single breach could otherwise grant hackers access to multiple platforms, compounding the damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cybercrime costs the global economy billions of dollars annually. The effort required to create and maintain strong passwords pales in comparison to the consequences of a security failure. Just as you would invest in a sturdy lock to protect your home, you should prioritize secure passwords to safeguard your digital assets. In a world where data is increasingly valuable, this small step can make a world of difference.\"\"\"\n",

    "low_quality_text = \"\"\"So, like, passwords are super important for, like, cyber-security and stuff. You know how there are hackers everywhere these days? They’re always trying to get into people’s accounts, which is kinda scary. It reminds me of this one time my cousin got hacked. It was so bad—like, they stole his email and even tried to get into his bank account or whatever. Anyway, this is why you’ve gotta make sure you’re using good passwords, but not something obvious like your birthday or your dog’s name. (By the way, my dog’s name is Max. He’s super cute, but yeah, don’t use that as a password.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, like, those IT security experts and computer nerds are always saying stuff like, “Use capitals and lowercase letters and numbers and those weird symbols on your keyboard.” You know, the ones you never use unless you’re doing something nerdy like coding or whatever? Oh, and they say to make your passwords really long. Like, the longer the better, I guess. I don’t know why, but it makes it harder for hackers, which is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passwords are kinda like keys to your house, but for the internet. Or maybe it’s more like a vault or something? I dunno, but it’s super important because if a hacker gets in, they can take all your stuff. And not just money—they can steal your identity or your Instagram account, which would be awful. So yeah, make good passwords. Like, seriously.\"\"\""
